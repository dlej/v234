title: 'Cross-Quality Few-Shot Transfer for Alloy Yield Strength Prediction: A New
  Materials Science Benchmark and A Sparsity-Oriented Optimization Framework'
openreview: V7mcfiSjIT
abstract: Discovering high-entropy alloys (HEAs) with high yield strength (YS) is
  crucial in materials science. However, the YS can only be accurately measured by
  expensive and time-consuming experiments, hence cannot be acquired at scale. Learning-based
  methods could facilitate the discovery, but the lack of a comprehensive dataset
  on HEA YS has created barriers. We present X-Yield, a materials science benchmark
  with 240 experimentally measured (high-quality) and over 100,000 simulated (low-quality)
  HEA YS data.  Due to the scarcity of experimental results and the quality gap with
  simulated data, existing transfer learning methods cannot generalize well on our
  dataset. We address this cross-quality few-shot transfer problem by leveraging model
  sparsification "twice" â€” as a noise-robust feature regularizer at the pre-training
  stage, and as a data-efficient regularizer at the transfer stage. While the workflow
  already performs decently with sparsity patterns tuned independently for either
  stage, we propose a bi-level optimization framework termed Bi-RPT, that jointly
  learns optimal masks and allocates sparsity for both stages. The effectiveness of
  Bi-RPT is validated through experiments on X-Yield, alongside other testbeds. Specifically,
  we achieve a reduction of 8.9-19.8% in test MSE and a gain of 0.98-1.53% in test
  accuracy, using only 5-10% of the hard-to-generate real experimental data. The codes
  are available in https://github.com/VITA-Group/Bi-RPT.
