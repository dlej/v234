title: Unsupervised Learning of Structured Representation via Closed-Loop Transcription
openreview: MF35ZwzpY5
abstract: This paper proposes an unsupervised method for learning a unified representation
  that serves both discriminative and generative purposes. While most existing unsupervised
  learning approaches focus on a representation for only one of these two goals, we
  show that a unified representation can enjoy the mutual benefits of having both.
  Such a representation is attainable by generalizing the recently proposed closed-loop
  transcription framework, known as CTRL, to the unsupervised setting. This entails
  solving a constrained maximin game over a rate reduction objective that expands
  features of all samples while compressing features of augmentations of each sample.
  Through this process, we see discriminative low-dimensional structures emerge in
  the resulting representations.  Under comparable experimental conditions and network
  complexities, we demonstrate that these structured representations enable classification
  performance close to state-of-the-art unsupervised discriminative representations,
  and conditionally generated image quality significantly higher than that of state-of-the-art
  unsupervised generative models.
