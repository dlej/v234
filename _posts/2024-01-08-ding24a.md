title: 'HARD: Hyperplane ARrangement Descent'
openreview: jMUDBpnZPa
abstract: The problem of clustering points on a union of subspaces finds numerous
  applications in machine learning and computer vision, and it has been extensively
  studied in the past two decades. When the subspaces are low-dimensional, the problem
  can be formulated as a convex sparse optimization problem, for which numerous accurate,
  efficient and robust methods exist. When the subspaces are of high relative dimension
  (e.g., hyperplanes), the problem is intrinsically non-convex, and existing methods
  either lack theory, are computationally costly, lack robustness to outliers, or
  learn hyperplanes one at a time. In this paper, we propose Hyperplane ARangentment
  Descent (HARD), a method that robustly learns all the hyperplanes simultaneously
  by solving a novel non-convex non-smooth $\ell_1$ minimization problem. We provide
  geometric conditions under which the ground-truth hyperplane arrangement is a coordinate-wise
  minimizer of our objective. Furthermore, we devise efficient algorithms, and give
  conditions under which they converge to coordinate-wise minimizes. We provide empirical
  evidence that HARD surpasses state-of-the-art methods and further show an interesting
  experiment in clustering deep features on CIFAR-10.
