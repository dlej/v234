title: Decoding Micromotion in Low-dimensional Latent Spaces from StyleGAN
openreview: jRVS6C3Wia
abstract: The disentanglement of StyleGAN latent space has paved the way for realistic
  and controllable image editing, but does StyleGAN know anything about temporal motion,
  as it was only trained on static images? To study the motion features in the latent
  space of StyleGAN, in this paper, we hypothesize and demonstrate that a series of
  meaningful, natural, and versatile small, local movements (referred to as "micromotion",
  such as expression, head movement, and aging effect) can be represented in low-rank
  spaces extracted from the latent space of a conventionally pre-trained StyleGAN-v2
  model for face generation, with the guidance of proper "anchors" in the form of
  either short text or video clips. Starting from one target face image, with the
  editing direction decoded from the low-rank space, its micromotion features can
  be represented as simple as an affine transformation over its latent feature. Perhaps
  more surprisingly, such micromotion subspace, even learned from just single target
  face, can be painlessly transferred to other unseen face images, even those from
  vastly different domains (such as oil painting, cartoon, and sculpture faces). It
  demonstrates that the local feature geometry corresponding to one type of micromotion
  is aligned across different face subjects, and hence that StyleGAN-v2 is indeed
  “secretly” aware of the subject-disentangled feature variations caused by that micromotion.
  As an application, we present various successful examples of applying our low-dimensional
  micromotion subspace technique to directly and effortlessly manipulate faces. Compared
  with previous editing methods, our framework shows high robustness, low computational
  overhead, and impressive domain transferability. Our code is publicly available
  at https://github.com/wuqiuche/micromotion-StyleGAN.
