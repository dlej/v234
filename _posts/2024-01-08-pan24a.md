title: 'PC-X: Profound Clustering via Slow Exemplars'
openreview: yhGKPtRoOx
abstract: Deep clustering aims at learning clustering and data representation jointly
  to deliver clustering-friendly representation. In spite of their significant improvements
  in clustering accuracy, existing approaches are far from meeting the requirements
  from other perspectives, such as universality, interpretability and efficiency,
  which become increasingly important with the emerging demand for diverse applications.
  We introduce a new framework named Profound Clustering via slow eXemplars (PC-X),
  which fulfils the above four basic requirements simultaneously.  In particular,
  PC-X encodes data within the auto-encoder (AE) network to reduce its dependence
  on data modality (\textit{universality}).  Further, inspired by exemplar-based clustering,
  we design a \PCX{Centroid-Integration Unit (CI-Unit)}, which not only facilitate
  the suppression of sample-specific details for better representation learning  (\textit{accuracy}),
  but also prompt clustering centroids to become legible exemplars (\textit{interpretability}).
  Further, these exemplars are calibrated stably with mini-batch data following our
  tailor-designed optimization scheme and converges in linear (\textit{efficiency}).
  Empirical results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of PC-X in terms
  of universality, interpretability and efficiency, in addition to clustering accuracy.
