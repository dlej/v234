title: 'HRBP: Hardware-friendly Regrouping towards Block-based Pruning for Sparse
  CNN Training'
openreview: VP1Xrdz0Bp
abstract: 'Pruning at initialization and training a sparse network from scratch (sparse
  training) become increasingly popular. However, most sparse training literature
  addresses only the unstructured sparsity, which in practice brings little benefit
  to the training acceleration on GPU due to the irregularity of non-zero weights.
  In this paper, we work on sparse training with fine-grained structured sparsity,
  by extracting a few dense blocks from unstructured sparse weights. For Convolutional
  Neural networks (CNN), however, the extracted dense blocks will be broken in backpropagation
  due to the shape transformation of convolution filters implemented by GEMM. Thus,
  previous block-wise pruning methods can only be used to accelerate the forward pass
  of sparse CNN training. To this end, we propose Hardware-friendly Regrouping towards
  Block-based Pruning (HRBP), where the grouping is conducted on the kernel-wise mask.
  With HRBP, extracted dense blocks are preserved in backpropagation. Extensive experiments
  on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet demonstrate that HRBP can almost match the
  accuracy of unstructured sparse training methods while achieving a huge acceleration
  on hardware.  Code is available at: https://github.com/HowieMa/HRBP-pruning.'
