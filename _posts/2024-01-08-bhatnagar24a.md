title: Piecewise-Linear Manifolds for Deep Metric Learning
openreview: Z0Fk5MyxkY
abstract: Unsupervised deep metric learning (UDML) focuses on learning a semantic
  representation space using only unlabeled data. This challenging problem requires
  accurately estimating the similarity between data points, which is used to supervise
  a deep network. For this purpose, we propose to model the high-dimensional data
  manifold using a piecewise-linear approximation, with each low-dimensional linear
  piece approximating the data manifold in a small neighborhood of a point. These
  neighborhoods are used to estimate similarity between data points. We empirically
  show that this similarity estimate correlates better with the ground truth than
  the similarity estimates of current state-of-the-art techniques. We also show that
  proxies, commonly used in supervised metric learning, can be used to model the piecewise-linear
  manifold in an unsupervised setting, helping improve performance. Our method outperforms
  existing unsupervised metric learning approaches on standard zero-shot image retrieval
  benchmarks.
