title: 'Balance is Essence: Accelerating Sparse Training via Adaptive Gradient Correction'
openreview: Pby7pqtBYN
abstract: 'Despite impressive performance, deep neural networks require significant
  memory and computation costs, prohibiting their application in resource-constrained
  scenarios. Sparse training is one of the most common techniques to reduce these
  costs, however, the sparsity constraints add difficulty to the optimization, resulting
  in an increase in training time and instability. In this work, we aim to overcome
  this problem and achieve space-time co-efficiency. To accelerate and stabilize the
  convergence of sparse training, we analyze the gradient changes and develop an adaptive
  gradient correction method. Specifically, we approximate the correlation between
  the current and previous gradients, which is used to balance the two gradients to
  obtain a corrected gradient. Our method can be used with the most popular sparse
  training pipelines under both standard and adversarial setups. Theoretically, we
  prove that our method can accelerate the convergence rate of sparse training. Extensive
  experiments on multiple datasets, model architectures, and sparsities demonstrate
  that our method outperforms leading sparse training methods by up to \textbf{5.0%}
  in accuracy given the same number of training epochs, and reduces the number of
  training epochs by up to \textbf{52.1%} to achieve the same accuracy. Our code is
  available on: \url{https://github.com/StevenBoys/AGENT}.'
