title: 'Jaxpruner: A Concise Library for Sparsity Research'
openreview: H2rCZCfXkS
abstract: 'This paper introduces JaxPruner, an open-source JAX-based pruning and sparse
  training library for machine learning research. JaxPruner aims to accelerate research
  on sparse neural networks by providing concise implementations of popular pruning
  and sparse training algorithms with minimal memory and latency overhead. Algorithms
  implemented in JaxPruner use a common API and work seamlessly with the popular optimization
  library Optax, which, in turn, enables easy integration with existing JAX based
  libraries. We demonstrate this ease of integration by providing examples in four
  different codebases: Scenic, t5x, Dopamine and FedJAX and provide baseline experiments
  on popular benchmarks. Jaxpruner is hosted at github.com/google-research/jaxpruner'
