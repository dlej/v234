title: Deep Self-expressive Learning
openreview: g2amnrrMP0
abstract: 'Self-expressive model is a method for clustering data drawn from a union
  of low-dimensional linear subspaces. It gains a lot of popularity due to its: 1)
  simplicity, based on the observation that each data point can be expressed as a
  linear combination of the other data points, 2) provable correctness under broad
  geometric and statistical conditions, and 3) many extensions for handling corrupted,
  imbalanced, and large-scale real data. This paper extends the self-expressive model
  to a Deep sELf-expressiVE model (DELVE) for handling the more challenging case that
  the data lie in a union of nonlinear manifolds. DELVE is constructed from stacking
  self-expressive layers, each of which maps each data point to a linear combination
  of the other data points, and can be trained via minimizing self-expressive losses.  With
  such a design, the operator, architecture, and training of DELVE have the explicit
  interpretation of producing progressively linearized representations from the input
  data in nonlinear manifolds. Moreover, by leveraging existing understanding and
  techniques for self-expressive models, DELVE has a collection of benefits such as
  design choice by principles, robustness via specialized layers, and efficiency via
  specialized optimizers. We demonstrate on image datasets that DELVE can effectively
  perform data clustering, remove data corruptions, and handle large scale data.'
