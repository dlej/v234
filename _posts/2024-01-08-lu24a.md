title: 'FIXED: Frustratingly Easy Domain Generalization with Mixup'
openreview: iW26qcPlui
abstract: Domain generalization (DG) aims to learn a generalizable model from multiple
  training domains such that it can perform well on unseen target domains. A popular
  strategy is to augment training data to benefit generalization through methods such
  as Mixup [1]. While the vanilla Mixup can be directly applied, theoretical and empirical
  investigations uncover several shortcomings that limit its performance. Firstly,
  Mixup cannot effectively identify the domain and class information that can be used
  for learning invariant representations. Secondly, Mixup may introduce synthetic
  noisy data points via random interpolation, which lowers its discrimination capability.
  Based on the analysis, we propose a simple yet effective enhancement for Mixup-based
  DG, namely domain-invariant Feature mIXup (FIX). It learns domain-invariant representations
  for Mixup. To further enhance discrimination, we leverage existing techniques to
  enlarge margins among classes to further propose the domain-invariant Feature MIXup
  with Enhanced Discrimination (FIXED) approach. We present theoretical insights about
  guarantees on its effectiveness. Extensive experiments on seven public datasets
  across two modalities including image classification (Digits-DG, PACS, Office-Home)
  and time series (DSADS, PAMAP2, UCI-HAR, and USC-HAD) demonstrate that our approach
  significantly outperforms nine state-of-the-art related methods, beating the best
  performing baseline by 6.5% on average in terms of test accuracy. The code is available
