title: 'WS-iFSD: Weakly Supervised Incremental Few-shot Object Detection Without Forgetting'
openreview: y2ozeixGaU
abstract: Traditional object detection algorithms rely on extensive annotations from
  a pre-defined set of base categories, leaving them ill-equipped to identify objects
  from novel classes. We address this limitation by introducing a novel framework
  for Incremental Few-Shot Object Detection (iFSD). Leveraging a meta-learning approach,
  our \hypernetwork is designed to generate class-specific codes, enabling object
  recognition from both base and novel categories. To enhance the \hypernetworkâ€™s
  generalization performance, we propose a Weakly Supervised Class Augmentation technique
  that significantly amplifies the training data by merely requiring image-level labels
  for object localization. Additionally, we stabilize detection performance on base
  categories by freezing the backbone and detection heads during meta-training. Our
  model demonstrates significant performance gains on two major benchmarks. Specifically,
  it outperforms the state-of-the-art ONCE approach on the MS COCO dataset by margins
  of $2.8%$ and $20.5%$ in box AP for novel and base categories, respectively. When
  trained on MS COCO and cross-evaluated on PASCAL VOC, our model achieves a four-fold
  improvement in box AP compared to ONCE.
