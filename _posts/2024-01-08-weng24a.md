title: Sparse Fréchet sufficient dimension reduction via nonconvex optimization
openreview: uE1C3im4wF
abstract: In the evolving landscape of statistical learning, exploiting low-dimensional
  structures, particularly for non-Euclidean objects, is an essential and ubiquitous
  task with wide applications ranging from image analysis to biomedical research.
  Among the momentous developments in the non-Euclidean domain, Fréchet regression
  extends beyond Riemannian manifolds to study complex random response objects in
  a metric space with Euclidean features. Our work focuses on sparse Fréchet dimension
  reduction where the number of features far exceeds the sample size. The goal is
  to achieve parsimonious models by identifying a low-dimensional and sparse representation
  of features through sufficient dimension reduction. To this end, we construct a
  multitask regression model with synthetic responses and achieve sparse estimation
  by leveraging the minimax concave penalty. Our approach not only sidesteps inverting
  a large covariance matrix but also mitigates estimation bias in feature selection.
  To tackle the nonconvex optimization challenge, we develop a double approximation
  shrinkage-thresholding algorithm that combines a linear approximation to the penalty
  term and a quadratic approximation to the loss function. The proposed algorithm
  is efficient as each iteration has a clear and explicit solution. Experimental results
  for both simulated and real-world data demonstrate the superior performance of the
  proposed method compared to existing alternatives.
