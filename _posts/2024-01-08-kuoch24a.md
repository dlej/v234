title: Probing Biological and Artificial Neural Networks with Task-dependent Neural
  Manifolds
openreview: MxBS6aw5Gd
abstract: In recent years, growth in our understanding of the computations performed
  in both biological and artificial neural networks has largely been driven by either
  low-level mechanistic studies or global normative approaches. However, concrete
  methodologies for bridging the gap between these levels of abstraction remain elusive.
  In this work, we investigate the internal mechanisms of neural networks through
  the lens of neural population geometry, aiming to provide understanding at an intermediate
  level of abstraction, as a way to bridge that gap. Utilizing manifold capacity theory
  (MCT) from statistical physics and manifold alignment analysis (MAA) from high-dimensional
  statistics, we probe the underlying organization of task-dependent manifolds in
  deep neural networks and neural recordings from the macaque visual cortex. Specifically,
  we quantitatively characterize how different learning objectives lead to differences
  in the organizational strategies of these models and demonstrate how these geometric
  analyses are connected to the decodability of task-relevant information. Furthermore,
  these metrics show that macaque visual cortex data are more similar to unsupervised
  DNNs in terms of geometrical properties such as manifold position and manifold alignment.
  These analyses present a strong direction for bridging mechanistic and normative
  theories in neural networks through neural population geometry, potentially opening
  up many future research avenues in both machine learning and neuroscience.
