title: 'Image Quality Assessment: Integrating Model-centric and Data-centric Approaches'
openreview: GLQJH92m1m
abstract: Learning-based image quality assessment (IQA) has made remarkable progress
  in the past decade, but nearly all consider the two key components—model and data—in
  relative isolation. Specifically, model-centric IQA focuses on developing "better"
  objective quality methods on fixed and extensively reused datasets, with a great
  danger of overfitting. Data-centric IQA involves conducting psychophysical experiments
  to construct "better" human-annotated datasets, which unfortunately ignores current
  IQA models during dataset creation. In this paper, we first design a series of experiments
  to probe computationally that such isolation of model and data impedes further progress
  of IQA. We then describe a computational framework that integrates model-centric
  and data-centric IQA. As a specific example, we design computational modules to
  quantify the sampling-worthiness of candidate images based on blind IQA (BIQA) model
  predictions and deep content-aware features. Experimental results show that the
  proposed sampling-worthiness module successfully spots diverse failures of the examined
  BIQA models, which are indeed worthy samples to be included in next-generation datasets.
