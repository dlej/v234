title: Algorithm Design for Online Meta-Learning with Task Boundary Detection
openreview: LzhpSfqSXC
abstract: 'Online meta-learning has recently emerged as a marriage between batch meta-learning
  and online learning, for achieving the capability of quick adaptation on new tasks
  in a lifelong manner. However, most existing approaches focus on the restrictive
  setting where the distribution of the online tasks remains fixed with known task
  boundaries. In this work, we relax these assumptions and propose a novel algorithm
  for task-agnostic online meta-learning in non-stationary environments. More specifically,
  we first propose two simple but effective detection mechanisms of task switches
  and distribution shift based on empirical observations, which serve as a key building
  block for more elegant online model updates in our algorithm: the task switch detection
  mechanism allows reusing of the best model available for the current task at hand,
  and the distribution shift detection mechanism differentiates the meta model update
  in order to preserve the knowledge for in-distribution tasks and quickly learn the
  new knowledge for out-of-distribution tasks. In particular, our online meta model
  updates are based only on the current data, which eliminates the need of storing
  previous data as required in most existing methods. We further show that a sublinear
  task-averaged regret can be achieved for our algorithm under mild conditions. Empirical
  studies on three different benchmarks clearly demonstrate the significant advantage
  of our algorithm over related baseline approaches.'
